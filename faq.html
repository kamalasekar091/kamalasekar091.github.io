			</span>

			<div class="acc-container">

				<p>
					 Yes. While we do make Gluten Free / Dairy free/ Nut free/ Egg Free cakes, our facility
					 is not dedicated for above dietary conditions. Eventhough we take it very seriously to avoid 
					 any cross-contamination, <i><b>if you are highly allergic to above, we do not suggest having our cake</b></i>.
					 These are the procedures we generally use to minimise the risk for above dietery conditions.
					 <ol>
						<li>Use separate pans</li>
						<li> Have separate utensils, spatula, hand mixers  etc. </li>
						<li> Use separate tools for common decorations (icing bags/tips etc). Fondant tools are shared as my fondant is gluten free by default.</li>

						<li>To grease the pan I use my own mixture (shortening + oil + rice flour).</li>

						<li>We use commercially available gluten free / dairy free cake mixes for these cakes.</li>
						<li>For dairy free cakes, use rice milk for batter and icing.</li>
						<li>We use No Meringue powder ( used for icing).</li>
						<li>For special decorations / figurines we use rice krispies. </li>
